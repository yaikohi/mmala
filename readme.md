Simple service in actix.

## Development environments

I am learning about nix and development environments. Playing around with flakes was confusing and because I found simple abstractions devenv and devbox I've decided to play around with these two.

### Devenv

Uses the `devenv.nix` file to declare the required packages and dependencies. It also contains scripts.

Activate it by running `devenv shell`.

### Devbox

The `devbox.json` file contains the packages used by the project.

Activate the devbox environment running `devbox shell`.
